# ontove_writtenRecords
This ontological module is devised for the description of Bibliographic Cultural Heritage items and is called OntoVE_WrittenRecords. It has as its centre the semantic description of bibliographic items; it reuses LRMoo v 0.9.6 (Bekiari et al. 2023), Bibframe (https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/implementation/) and the Bibo (D’Arcus/Giasson 2016, https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/bibo/) ontology. The ontological module was developed with Protégé Desktop, version 5.5.0 (http://protege.stanford.edu, Musen 2015). 
The ontological module was created within the project OntoVE- Ontologies for the description of Germanic Cultural Heritage in Veneto within the perspective of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The project has as its goal the development of ontological modules for the description of Germanic Cultural Heritage (CH) items related to the Veneto region and provide different visualization outputs designed for both an academic and a non-academic audience. The project is being carried out at Ca’ Foscari university of Venice, in close collaboration with a partner IT company, Net7 (https://www.netseven.it/). It is funded by the Italian National Operational Programme (PON, http://www.ponricerca.gov.it/pon-ricerca/programme/) on Research and Innovation 2014-2020 and the European Social Fund (ESF, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/glossary/european-social-fund-esf.html) within the Recovery assistance for cohesion and the territories of Europe (REACT-EU, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/215/recovery-assistance-for-cohesion-and-the-territories-of-europe-react-eu-).
